# honkrc
A crappy init system(more like an init script runner) that is written primarily in C++. Scripts are written in bash.
Only single-threaded exectution works currently, planning support for multi-threaded mode later on, can't figure out how I can create a thread for each separate script, that's what's stopping me right now.
